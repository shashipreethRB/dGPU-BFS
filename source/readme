BFS Execution Guide
1.modify the myHosts file as per the hosts which we want to run on
2.Copy over the projectMPIAndCUDA folder to required nodes under home folder ('~')
3.Build the binaries on nodes if required (optional)
4.Issue make run command with nprocs variable set to no of processes you want to run on
Example command "make run nprocs=2"
5.We can use additional variables csrPath, vertex to give input to the program
csrPath: represents the path to csr representation of graph in csv format
0th row with row consisting row pointers and 1st row consisting of column Indices 
Both are delimited by ',' (comma)
6.The output of the program is saved under the logs folder under /projectMPIAndCUDA as out_$(nprocs)_procs where $(nprocs) represents the value passed to nprocs variable in make run command
